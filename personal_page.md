### About Me:
I am currently a senior at Stanford University.  I've finished my undergraduate coursework and this June will graduate with B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Math, focusing on AI and analysis.  I am currently in the Stanford Computer Science Masters program with a focus in theoretical computer science.  I also teach sections of computer science at Stanford and am involved in CS education.  In my spare time, I enjoy hacking in CoffeeScript and Python, building web services that bring a little AI magic to the public.
